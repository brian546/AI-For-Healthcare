# AI for Healthcare

## Overview
In this notebook, a binary classifier model is developed to detect a specific health condition by analyzing medical data. The dataset consists of 800 patient data, including 70 medical indicators (features) and a target (label) variable. It is divided into 3 sets for different purposes. The classification model is trained solely on the training set (600 samples), has its hyperparameters validated with the validation set (100 samples), and is ultimately evaluated using the testing set (100 samples).
